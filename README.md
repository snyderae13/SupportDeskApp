# SupportDeskApp
This is a Support Desk App that I built to have a better understanding of JWT, user authentication, and more practice in building MERN stack applications.
Inspiration for this application came from seeing something similar that I had used at a previous job to get in contact with techincal support on various issues.


#Features
This Support Desk App allows you to register, login, and create tickets. You can also view the tickets,and leave notes on said tickets. Once a ticket is completed we can then also delete the ticket. 

# Technology Used
React
MongoDB
Node.js
Redux

# Future Features
For this app, I think the functionality is fairly solid, however I think it needs some more styling or a more eye-catching color scheme.
